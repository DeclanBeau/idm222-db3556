        <p>For this scene, I wanted to capture a magical sort of feeling, with the light coming from the sky through the fog. To do this,  I took advantage of the volumetrics in Blender, which is something that the Cycles engine does well. I think that because of the volumetrics in this scene, I could capture that magical sense I was going for in the piece.</p>
