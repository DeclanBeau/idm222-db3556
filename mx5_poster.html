                    <p> This poster was made as a Chirstmas present to my brother, who has a Mazda Miata of his own. I got a picture of a Miata, and took it into Photoshop to change the color to the color of his, and posterize it, or take all of the detail out of it, to make it look like a cartoon. Then, it was just a matter of arranging everything and picking colors for the poster. I picked an off-white color, and red to sort of match the flag of Japan, since it's a Japanese car. Finally, I added some text and some details to put finishing touches on it. </p>
