        <p>This made at a point where I was exploring different ways of using Blender to create stylized pieces, like trying to caputre a hand-drawn style. I did this by using texture nodes to change the way the shadows looked, so that there were only dark tones and light tones, and I tried to eliminate mid tones as much as possible. Then, I positioned the ligts in a really specific layout to control exactly what was shaded and what was not. Finally, Blender's Eevee render engine has a seeting called freestyle, where it outlines wherever there is a line on your model, so I just had to enable that, and it worked perfectly for what I needed. </p>
