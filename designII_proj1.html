        <p>This project is the first one I did in my Design II for Media class. In this assignment, we had to take objects that we had scanned, and turn them into anything we wanted to. I chose a coiled snake, because it creates a natural focal point where the head is. Making this in Photoshop was super tedious, since every shape is placed, and I needed to place these in a way that not only looked good, but made sense. The amount of layers started to slow down my computer as well, which only made the project more difficult.</p>
