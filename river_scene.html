        <p> I did this scene after completing an online course about creating 3D landscapes in Blender. For this piece, I was inspired by Bob Ross' landscape paintings, and I think I captured this with the mountain in the background, and the trees reflecting onto the water, which is something that he did a lot in his work. I also wanted to add fog into the scene to divide up the foreground from the background. What I would have done to capture this is to use volumetric fog, but that takes a while to render, so I decided to use 2D gradient textures to create the illusion of fog, which was something that the course had gone over.  </p>
