        <p>This scene was made using a geomentry node setup I purchased from the Blender Store. Basically, you would create a shape, and the nodes would use a combonation of assets to create a building out of that shape. I did this three times, changed around the amount of detail in some of the buildings, added lighting, and rendered it. The node setup was super easy to work with and made making intricate buildings like the ones in the scene super quick and easy. </p>
